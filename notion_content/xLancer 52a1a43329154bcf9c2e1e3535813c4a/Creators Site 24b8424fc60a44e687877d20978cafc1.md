The creators collective is a platform that aims to create a home for underground creators to  escape the matrix together. CC is an experiment to provide an alternative path to the current gig marketplaces and agencies that seek to extract value vs create it. Creators go on missions, rack up bounties, and keep 100% of what they earn. Powered by AI, every mission makes you stronger, with an eternal record in the lancer ledger to visualise your growth and income.  The site allows creators to take ownership of their work and reviews, and take control back from central powers only interested in high fees to increase returns for their shareholders. Creators can join the freedom economy by signing up for the invite-only platform, where they can get fulfilling work that best fits their skills, experience, and interests. They can gain reputation and trust effortlessly, with missions and contributions showcased on-chain, making it easier to build trust and attract more clients. The platform provides the opportunity to go on dream projects and avoid the ones that don't fit. Creators remain in control, managing their workload according to their preferences and schedule. Secure and transparent engagements are enabled by integrating blockchain technology, with smart contracts safeguarding engagements, payments, work history, and even identity. With the Creator Collective, creators can revolutionize their talent, moving from hunting clients and competing for price, to having multiple income sources by contributing to multiple projects, keeping 100% of their earnings, and having clients come to them.
