# Letter from founder

Current situation
Lots of companies laying off
Biggest lie; you need to be an employee and it costs a lot to start a business
We’re all in this to make money
Biggest potential missed by crypto and NFTs
Casino had its time - builders and creators turn
Anons are more powerful than corporates - we live this stuff, not just talk about it or take little courses. We’re builders.
Time to get out McDonald’s forever. Don’t waste your talents on it. You deserve more.

You can start a solo creator business
Well even give you the clients for you
Charge and keep whatever you want

The industry? Any and all that are adopting edge tech
(The fast growing ones)

Ai take your job?
No ai will help you find a job

Source (communities)
Lancers (the creators and freelancers with valuable skills)

The entry level in emerging tech is 0
Just need to have passion + put in the grind

We’ll match you with companies that are needing that

Complete noob and not sure where to start?
Well intro you to real cool communities that will act as your dojo
