### In Short:

The old way of outsourcing work has been broken for a long time. We’re changing that

Lancer X is a platform that uses AI and blockchain to connect clients with the best creators for their needs. Clients submit "Missions" containing the specific outcomes they want to achieve and creators can accept the missions they want, submit bids, and earn on all their projects and contributions over the network. 

Read on to find out Lancer X positioning, features, revenue model, growth strategies, and benefits.

## `WHAT IS IT`

A revolutionary approach to outsourcing in the age of Web3

Freelancing 3.0 (that good it skipped 2.0)

Think of Lancer X as ‘the’ places companies and Lancers come to find each other

When Teams need something done they usually have a few options: Agencies, freelancers, gig marketplaces, or recruiters. They all have their pros and cons (we dunk on all of them later), but now there’s a new option, built with both Lancers AND companies in mind.

> Companies loves us because they can tap into the top Web3 talent, on demand
> 

As a result they build leaner companies that achieve scale, without killing their profits.]

> Creators build wealth doing what they love while retaining their autonomy and freedom
> 

Focusing on good work without worrying about where their next client will come from.

## `LANCER X VS OTHERS`

### `OLD WAY`

- Agencies:
    
    90% suck. 9% average at best. 1% actually good, but expensive
    
    - Slow
    - Stuck in a competitive state
    - Fake agencies flooding the market. (Fake screenshots, results, testimonials)
    - Notoriously hard to fire
- Freelancers:
    
    90% suck 9% great but in hiding, 1% high price or unavailable
    
    - Take weeks to vet
    - 90% just suck
    - Good ones are hard to find or become too expensive
    - Single point of failure (sick, life, etc)
    - Usually hired 1 by 1 - coordination between them is hard
    - Work history hard to get verified
- Marketplaces:
    - Closed systems (chat, payment, reviews)
    - Leave you to wander aimlessly for the right person
    - Force creators to fight on pricing and reviews
    - Marketplaces keep freelancing single-player (closed system)
    - Expensive for both creator and client (upwards of 10-20%)
- Recruiting platforms:
    - Expensive - taking a huge chunk
    - Have to be long-term hires - eats into profits
- FTH:
    
    It costs roughly $4,700 and takes 42 days to fill an open position.
    
    - Expensive long-term option
    - Long process if doing solo
    - Healthcare, insurance, benefits, etc - hard for anyone without a large runway
    - HR nightmare

Current State of DAOs

- DAO’s have bad onboarding flows (both Client and Contributor)
- DAO’s suck lead gen, and therefore growth
- DAO’s limit creator output (responses are often rigid - needing to fit a specific template)
- DAO’s aren’t great at matching client and creator

For Creators

- Not getting recognised, fighting for attention in the algorithm
- Fighting on price in marketplaces
- Traditional employment chains you to one income
- Limited by hourly rates most of the time
- Famine - feast cycles. Prospecting then delivering endless cycle

### `**NEW WAY**`

**Clients**: have a lean team and outsource to top creators for whatever they’re missing

**Creators**: stay autonomous and build wealth doing what they love

**Lancer Network**

- Not an agency
- We assemble a team built just for you
- manage the whole process FOR YOU (one subscription)
- Highly vetted
- 48 hour kick-off
- Visible deadlines for milestone delivery
- One simple subscription built around you. Cancel anytime
- Or one time requests

- For the clients
    - Fast kick off. Match you with a team or submit project same day. One subscription
    - Don’t need to spend 273 hours vetting
    - Doxxed creators - safe
    - Don’t need to spend weeks and months searching for another freelancer or agency, we will set you up with a new team if things aren’t going smooth.
    - We project manage and act as POC (but we won’t bug you)
    - Hire for project. Then can do an ongoing subscription for the guild
    - Keep team lean, and avoid burning runway of some operations. Avoid laying off FTE.
    - Leave old system behind. No more 9-5 bad work.
    - Democratise talent: access it for cheaper, and better. More startups. More innovation. More income scale for individuals
- For creators
    - Work and clients come to you based on your skills, availability and level
    - A wage imprisons you to one owner. Keeps you locked up and give up on a life on your terms. It now belongs to a boss. To build someone else’s dream. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can be free and provide value with your skills. There’s another way
    - Ownership: Share of the DAO, share of client tokens, part of rev.share deals, and other incentives drive higher quality and better performance. Ownership changes the effort and contribution levels
    - Independence - fuel for your digital freedom business
    - Not starting from 0. Same way Lens provides the foundation for dev teams to build great apps and focus on UX… Lancer provides flows, systems, processes, guild support, escrow, etc - for creators to kickstart their income and growth here
    - No 9-5 ever again. Leave that shit behind. Take control of your schedule
    - Don’t need to chase clients for payments. We pay right away
    - Don’t need to chase clients for testimonials. We mint rich NFTs that record your work
    - High quality clients, no BS
    
    TL;DR: Greater autonomy, ownership, share of the upside, as well as opportunities for collaboration and professional growth.
    

- Why me (founder)
    - Always poor until figured out how to make money from digital skills
    - since uni working random dead end jobs felt like my talents and time were wasted when not building an income online
    - Made 6 figure run rate by learning digital skills and launching agencies
    - All in on the freedom economy. Life on your terms. Matrix can be escaped. Employment is a chain. Creating this as a vehicle for people to get out through talent and value drives

### How it works

- We create the “Lancer Platform” where web3 talent meets companies that need them
    - Creators are vetted based on experience, skills, history
    - Ceators are also placed into guilds based on their skills
- Teams of all sizes can tap into it on command whenever they want
    - By submitting mission. These are outcomes that they want like “redesign a landing page”
    - Or forming a Fractional Team. For larger projects that require more
- Clients submits a Mission.
    - A quote is given based on the creators and guild’s pricing rate
- An AI takes this request and matches it to an appropriate creator. They have some time to accept/decline this request
    - If accepted, the client confirms and the project kicks off once the payment hits escrow
    - If declined, a new creator is notified and they have to accept/reject
- For larger projects, clients can choose to assemble a fractional team
    - A set subscription fee is created based on the people required + level of work involved
    - This keeps things cohesive on the Lancer side without being fragmented
- At any point, creators can ask for help from the guild/broader Lancer DAO.
    - Feedback can help resolve issues
    - Creators can invite contributors to help directly too
    - It’s up to you to honour their work and tip them afterwards (reputation system in place to incentivise this)
- Completed work gets automatically minted and recorded on the blockchain and visible on the Lancer’s profile
    - Client can use company email or social media and a non-custodial wallet to confirm their engagement
- Connectors that refer clients and creators to the platform will earn a revshare % of the Creator’s missions (2% of the network’s 10%)
