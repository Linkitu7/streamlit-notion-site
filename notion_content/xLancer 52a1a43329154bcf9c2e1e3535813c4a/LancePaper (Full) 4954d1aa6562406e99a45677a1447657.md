**`LANCER HAS MANY NAMES`**

- Multiplayer Freelancing
- The underground talent layer of Web3
- Community-powered agency

### TL;DR Version:

The old way of outsourcing work has been broken for a long time. We’re changing that

Lancer X is a platform that uses AI and blockchain to connect clients with the best lancers for their needs. Clients submit "Missions" containing the specific outcomes they want to achieve and lancers can accept the missions they want, submit bids, and earn on all their projects and contributions over the network. 

Read on to find out Lancer X positioning, features, revenue model, growth strategies, and benefits.

## `WHAT IS IT`

When Teams need something done they usually have a few options: Agencies, freelancers, gig marketplaces, or recruiters. They all have their pros and cons (we dunk on all of them later), but now there’s a new option, built with both Lancers AND companies in mind.

Lancer X is a platform that uses AI and blockchain to connect clients with the best creators for their needs. Clients submit "Missions" containing the specific outcomes they want to achieve and creators can accept the missions they want, submit bids, and earn on all their projects and contributions over the network. 

You can think of it as Freelancing 3.0 (that good it skipped 2.0)

> Companies loves us because they can tap into the top Web3 talent, on demand
> 

As a result they build leaner companies that achieve scale, without killing their profits.]

> Creators build wealth doing what they love while retaining their autonomy and freedom
> 

Focusing on good work without worrying about where their next client will come from.

We believe the Freedom Economy (creator economy) is THE economy of the future, and we enable that layer of the world to take place.

## `THE LANCERX DIFFERENCE`

- have 639292 shots at finding the right person vs 1-10 you typically have
- Communities are empowered
- Freelancers win

### `OLD WAY`

- Agencies:
    
    90% suck. 9% average at best. 1% actually good, but expensive
    
    - Slow
    - Focused on making more money vs helping you
    - Stuck in a competitive state
    - Fake agencies flooding the market. (Fake screenshots, results, testimonials)
    - Notoriously hard to fire
- Freelancers:
    - Take weeks to vet
    - 90% below average (easy market to get into)
    - Good ones are hard to find or become too expensive
    - Single point of failure (sick, life, etc)
    - Usually hired 1 by 1 - coordination between them is hard
    - Work history hard to get verified
- Marketplaces:
    - Closed systems (chat, payment, reviews)
    - Leave you to wander aimlessly for the right person
    - Force creators to fight on pricing and reviews
    - Marketplaces keep freelancing single-player (closed system)
    - Expensive for both creator and client (upwards of 10-20%)
- Recruiting platforms:
    - Expensive - taking a huge chunk
    - Have to be long-term hires - eats into profits
- FTH:
    
    It costs roughly $4,700 and takes 42 days to fill an open position.
    
    - Expensive long-term option
    - Long process if doing solo
    - Healthcare, insurance, benefits, etc - hard for anyone without a large runway
    - HR nightmare
- Current State of DAOs
    - DAO’s have bad onboarding flows (both Client and Contributor)
    - DAO’s suck lead gen, and therefore growth
    - DAO’s limit creator output (responses are often rigid - needing to fit a specific template)
    - DAO’s aren’t great at matching client and creator
- For Creators
    - Not getting recognised, fighting for attention in the algorithm
    - Fighting on price in marketplaces
    - Traditional employment chains you to one income
    - Limited by hourly rates most of the time
    - Famine - feast cycles. Prospecting then delivering endless cycle

### `**NEW WAY**`

**Clients**: have a lean team and outsource to top creators for whatever they’re missing

**Creators**: stay autonomous and build wealth doing what they love

**Lancer Network**

- Highly vetted talent
- Record-time start
- Visible deadlines for milestone delivery

- For the clients
    - Fast kick off. Match you with a team or submit project same day. One subscription
    - Don’t need to spend 273 hours vetting
    - Doxxed creators - safe
    - Don’t need to spend weeks and months searching for another freelancer or agency, we will set you up with a new team if things aren’t going smooth.
    - We project manage and act as POC (but we won’t bug you)
    - Hire for project. Then can do an ongoing subscription for the guild
    - Keep team lean, and avoid burning runway of some operations. Avoid laying off FTE.
    - Leave old system behind. No more 9-5 bad work.
    - Democratise talent: access it for cheaper, and better. More startups. More innovation. More income scale for individuals
- For creators
    - Work and clients come to you based on your skills, availability and level
    - A wage imprisons you to one owner. Keeps you locked up and give up on a life on your terms. It now belongs to a boss. To build someone else’s dream. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can be free and provide value with your skills. There’s another way
    - Ownership: Share of the DAO, share of client tokens, part of rev.share deals, and other incentives drive higher quality and better performance. Ownership changes the effort and contribution levels
    - Independence - fuel for your digital freedom business
    - Not starting from 0. Same way Lens provides the foundation for dev teams to build great apps and focus on UX… Lancer provides flows, systems, processes, guild support, escrow, etc - for creators to kickstart their income and growth here
    - No 9-5 ever again. Leave that shit behind. Take control of your schedule
    - Don’t need to chase clients for payments. We pay right away
    - Don’t need to chase clients for testimonials. We mint rich NFTs that record your work
    - High quality clients, no BS
    
    TL;DR: Greater autonomy, ownership, share of the upside, as well as opportunities for collaboration and professional growth.
    

- Why me (founder)
    - Always poor until figured out how to make money from digital skills
    - since uni working random dead end jobs felt like my talents and time were wasted when not building an income online
    - Made 6 figure run rate by learning digital skills and launching agencies
    - All in on the freedom economy. Life on your terms. Matrix can be escaped. Employment is a chain. Creating this as a vehicle for people to get out through talent and value drives

---

## `MISSION`

I believe the skills people have are wasted on 9-5 jobs. You should grow and develop these essential business skills by contributing to the free market, working on dream projects and raising your power levels as a result. You can use this unlock massive freedom in your lives and be ready for the next phase: building something of your own. This is the idea behind the creator collective and it’s platform: lancer x

We enable this reality by matching creators to dream projects designed to make it stress deee for them to make an income online. This provides businesses with talent they need without the traditional roadblocks.

We’re able to do this because we’re not a faceless extractive freelancer marketplace like fiverr or upwork and instead built on collective value and distribution of upside directly to the users of the networks - aligning incentives and building a sustainable protocol for the future of work online

- Perpetuate the adoption of the Freedom Economy and Web3 tech
- Get 1000 creators out of the matrix and become self-sovereign
- Generate >$1B in value as a collective
- Let more companies unlock scale higher and faster without killing profits

## `OUR THESIS`

- Companies will continue to go leaner. Outsourcing the rest.
- The best talent is global, self-sovereign, remote-natives
- The best talent are active in communities, passionate and developing their field (we partner with Discords and creators) - reach them where they train
- Creator Economy is THE future economy (more companies, less employees)

## `HOW IT WORKS`

- **The Flow**
    - We create the “Lancer Platform” where web3 talent meets companies that need them
        - Creators are vetted based on experience, skills, history
        - Ceators are also placed into guilds based on their skills
    - Teams can tap into it on command whenever they want
        - By submitting mission. These are outcomes that they want like “redesign a landing page”
        - Or forming a Fractional Team. For larger projects that require more
    - Clients submit a Mission.
        - The more details in the mission request, the easier it will be to match the creator
        - They see a suggested price, based on previous data on similar missions.
        - Client can also set their own pricing for the mission
    - An AI takes this request and matches it to an appropriate creator.
        - Creator can put up their hand for the mission with their pricing
        - Client can review the creator, their history and portfolio
        - Client can accept/reject them
        - If rejected, new creators will be matched
        - If accepted by both the client sends payment into the smart escrow
    - Mission kicks off
    - At any point, creators can ask for help from the guild/broader Lancer DAO.
        - Feedback can help resolve issues
        - Creators can invite contributors to help directly too
        - It’s up to you to honour their work and tip them afterwards (reputation system in place to incentivise this)
    - Completed work gets automatically minted and recorded on the blockchain and visible on the Lancer’s profile
        - Client can use company email or social media and a non-custodial wallet to confirm their engagement
    - Connectors that refer clients and creators to the platform will earn a rev. share % of the Creator’s missions (2% of the network’s 10%)

**`Mission`** is the first way clients can interact with the network. They’re used to achieve a desired outcome (ex: smart contract written, website redesign, tokenomics built).

Perfect for teams of any size

Mission submit → relevant creators notified about mission → they put up their hand → client look through → Select one → Create pay link → kick off

`**crews**` are specialised teams assembled when big missions arise. They’re like fractional teams for startups

Space pirate crew mode

input brief → creators assembled → milestones defined → price set → accept/reject → work and  bounty split among crew

---

As the network develops, we will be able to introduce new ways to tap into the network:

Some ideas for those:

**DAO:** submit to a guild. Receive bids for work. Lancer X takes % of every transaction

**Subscription Access:** Unlimited requests to a guild (design, marketing, animation, content)

Good for large teams that need constant help

Select team to access → subscription payment start → submit tasks → get results in 2 days for simple requests

---

- ***Client Step by step***
    1. Tell us what you’re trying to achieve
    2. Submit your mission
    3. If mission, build a brief
    4. Assemble the crew (accept)
    5. “Your team has worked with “x, y, z”
    6. Roll out → Pay → kick-off
    7. If crypto, payments are instant and free. Same for refunds if you really want one ;)
    8. See progress and ask along the way

---

- ***Lancer step by step***
    1. Join guilds: tell us the type of projects you work on. Input your skills, interestes, availability, what you’re good at, bad at, etc
    2. Missions come in. Accept/rejected 
    3. Complete. Earn. Repeat. Get rewarded.

## `USE CASES`

- One-person businesses that want to outsource some work, operations, on-demand
- Startups where core team are missing core functions - they can use our Fractional Teams
- Companies that want to stay lean. And not eat into profits then end up using tools like this: [https://gloat.com/platform/the-talent-marketplace/](https://gloat.com/platform/the-talent-marketplace/)
- Teams that need a specific outcome like building a website, developing an app, writing a whitepaper (ayy), writing a smart contract, launching a token
- Crowdsource feedback by submitting feedback and consulting to the guild. The guild will form their comments and feedback based on their lense.
- Young creators that want to gain experience and contribute and prove themselves
- Connectors who are well networked or have a community of talent: can earn from continued usage of the network
- Creators with a community that want to utilize their skills (we will vet and match them on your behalf using AI) - presenting the best candidates to you at the end

## `FOR WHO`

- COMPANIES, TEAMS, BRANDS: who need work done, but don’t have the talent for it, resources to get it, or time to find it
- AGENCIES: who want to reliably outsource and get high quality work in return to expand their offerings or increase their output
- CREATORS: The skilled who love what they do, but ready for a better way to grow their skill-based business

## `THE MOAT (USP)`

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/globe_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/globe_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Our ability to match clients with the perfect creator for their needs will be designed to be the best in the world

</aside>

**AI powered matchmaking:** Simple UI AI-Interface to build their mission and match clients with creators to achieve their desired outcome

**Connector:** Referrers for creators and clients will earn % of network fees enabled through our smart contracts

**Freedom Business:** Helping creators grow income, not climb a ladder with a job

**On chain:** Proof of Work + anonymous-friendly

**Flexible:** Different avenues of engagement depending on circumstances: projects, guilds, teams

**Web3 focus:** New web work. Nothing else.

**Brand.** Not take ourselves seriously. Attracts certain type of creators and clients - everyone likes working together

## `FEATURES/BENEFITS`

- **`Missions:`** Missions are projects that are sent to the collective through Telegram or Discord. Creators can choose to either raise their hand, or reject these missions and pass it onto someone else.
    - Gamification: They will earn points if they pass onto someone else

- `**Guild Raids:**` crowdsourcing info.
Crowdfund info for a business from unique perspectives:
Example: copywriting, design, UX, CRO, email marketing, crypto legal. Top suited creators selected. Creators earn based on contribution (coordinape)

- **`DAO submit**:` You can open your mission up to feedback/contributions from other members. It’s up to you to reward them with tips.

- **`Proof of work:`** The platform records on-chain data of any missions completed. This largely solves trust issues. Client and Talent both sign these. Might open-source this in the future.

- **`XP:`** Creators and clients gain XP based on their activity on the network. This unlocks future benefits. For example: bigger projects for creators, and more savings for clients.

- **`Anon work**:` Trust systems allow creators to operate anonymously, based purely on their achievements, skills and history. We handle KYC and actions in case of bad actors.

- `**Lancer OS:**` The Future Hub for Lancers. Your on-chain history profile. Connected accounts (Dribbble, GitHub, wallet records, etc). Everything that’s yours, in one place.

- **`Social Signals:`** Recognize creators that have completed certain trainings (such as SPG for copywriters) . Contributions to DAO’s. We partner and create on-chain verification, rewarding unique skins for their Lancer NFT as a gamification element.

- **`Gamified:`** Personal Achievements for members in the form of NFTs. Ex: “First 10K earned”, “helped a brotha out”, etc - this also contributes towards your reputation score within the network.

- **`Proof of revenue**:` all transactions are visible on-chain for maximum transparency and fairness

- **`Progress updates:`** Constant updates on progress in DeWork and client chat

### `GROWTH STRATEGIES`

- Content: throw stones at the enemy. Marketplaces, agencies, recruiting, etc
- Resistance : community for the project. Made of creators saying no the old world.
- NFT projects, crypto projects, web3 startups, web3 agencies, trad agencies
- VC growth companies that need a hand without a full time hire commitment (spend money on acquisition and improving product)
- Partner with VCs - offer specific services to their portfolio of clients
- Partner with NFT Projects - provide utility for the builders in the community: let your members build for you and for others.
- Partner with education creators and companies. Get their talented creators work in web3 on their terms.
- Affiliate: Tokens/XP for referrals to the network that end up going through (perpetual)
- Gamification: Yokyo story revealed one pieces at a time, the more levels they get through (cotribution, projects, etc) - share a narrative together

**Product led growth:** SAAS model. First collaboration is free. To add more, need to upgrade to subscription plan

Narrative and culture driven through our brand, nft community and broader content from soshi and members

### `HOW LANCER X MAKES MONEY`

- Lancers earns 100% of what they charge
- LancerX collects 10% from the client at the end of each mission
- Starter tier (no fees): submit to an open job board. Not vetted, etc. just the infrastructure. Acts as gateway into the ecosystem
- LancerX creator memberships: get access to training, guides, templates, everything you need to scale → inside the Lancer X inner circle ($100/m)
- LancerX membership tiers: monthly memberships for clients that use it frequently. With faster access, more top tier talent, and no fees. ($100-200/m)
- A token will be created for governance
- NFTs will be digital collectibles with a store for artist collabs - that you can unlock and upgrade with XP earned from missions)

We’re open to exploring other models, and this should evolve over the growth of the network

## Personas

- The Ghosts
- The Underground
    
    
    Most talented freelancers sit behind a “contact me” button, and too busy working on their craft to fix that.

# Lancer X in a whitepaper

# Getting sh*t done in the age of Web3 (Freelancing and outsourcing 3.0)

## Abstract

We think people have had enough: the old way of outsourcing work has been broken for a long time. Slow agencies, month-long vetting processes, months of internal training investment, thieves disguised as middle-men… Need I go on? (I will later in this paper). Basically, the chance of finding ‘the one’ on time? Close to 1%. And the cost when hiring a bad one? Well…

And on the talent side: more and more people are rejecting the "work forever until you die" narrative in favour of the new creator path: one of freedom and autonomy. The best work is now accomplished through short, meaningful engagements designed to make an impact - where true value is revealed through on-chain history and reputation. Decentralized protocols are disrupting these outdated systems and the "top-down" approach of management with more open and flat networks.

Lancer X is one such network: An invite-only freelancer talent network that provides clients with access to a highly vetted team of creators for any project they have in mind, with the speed and efficiency of web3. The core innovation of Lancer X lies in its use of AI to match clients with the best creators for their specific needs, taking into account factors such as skills, history, and availability. In addition, Lancer X uses blockchain technology to ensure that all work history is recorded and engagements are secure and trustworthy.

On LancerX, clients post jobs by submitting "Missions" - specific outcomes they want to achieve (such as building a new NFT landing page). The clearer the mission, the better the matchmaking will be in finding the right Lancer/team to make it happen. Creators can accept the missions they want, submit bids, and contribute to open projects they would not otherwise get the chance to work on, while being able to instantly and programmatically earn on all their projects and contributions over the network.

This paper provides an overview of the Lancer Protocol, its market positioning, features, revenue model, growth strategies, and the benefits it offers both clients and creators.

</aside>

## The way it used to work (and why it doesn’t)

When you’re a business and you want something done that your core team cannot, you have several options available to you at the moment:

AGENCIES:

- Slow due to multiple layers of communication and decision-making
- Expensive: Agencies mark up their fees compared to other solutions like marketplaces or freelancers
- Lack of control: Clients have almost no control over the project and team members involved

## Overview of Lancer and Its mission

Lancer X is a platform that connects clients with the best creators for their needs using AI and blockchain technology. The platform allows clients to submit "Missions" containing specific outcomes they want to achieve, and creators can accept the missions they want, submit bids, and earn on all their projects and contributions over the network. Lancer X aims to revolutionize the talent acquisition process by providing a highly vetted network of creators, fast kick-off times, and transparent progress tracking. The platform is designed to cater to the needs of both clients and creators, providing greater autonomy and ownership for creators and leaner teams and greater access to Web3 talent for clients.

## Why We Made It

- Worked with agencies
- worked for mysekf
- seeing the inneficincies of large corporations and large agencies
- Creators that are talnted that arent getting the recognition and just hidden
- working wiht lean teams that need shit done, its hard to find the right people for the job
- wrong hires can cost the team dearly and set everyone back
- future is not employment, its the digital sovereign individual

    We believe in decentralization. We’re going to get there progressively. So in the future, we will seek ICO and create an ecosystem for the platform, to be truly owned by the people.
    
- **How do you ensure repeat clients?**
    
    Apart from the quality, speed, price - here’s how. We have an XP system for both client and creator - that rewards them for their activity on the network. Work is just more fun on LancerX. Proof of work is automagically minted on their profile. Creators also keep 100% of the earnings, so there’s no reason for them to leave. We also keep things safe for both sides vs going out on your own.

With guilds…. clients we run into might want to have little things done here and there. to make it really easy; we offer them access to the guild subscription that the guild has set up. Tasks can be worked in the team, and this can be voted on by the team members on how they want to work it. Our goal is to provide flexible payment options that works for clients the way they want to, and answers the market demand in a meaningful way, better than trad institutions would.

# LancerX: The Future of Freelancing in Web3

## Introduction

LancerX is an exclusive collective of the finest talent in the Web3 world. We are here to redefine freelancing and online work by bringing good work on-chain and making freelancing multiplayer. We connect freelancers to companies that need them and create fun, not boring work

## The Problem

The current state of freelancing is inefficient and plagued by a number of issues. Most agencies are slow, and there are lots of fake agencies flooding the market. Freelancers take weeks to vet, and 90% of them just suck. Marketplaces are closed systems that leave you to wander aimlessly for the right person, and recruiting platforms match you with a talented creator but leave you with an employee you have to manage. Furthermore, DAOs have bad onboarding flows and aren't great at matching client and creator.

## The Solution

LancerX is the answer to all these problems. Our flexible ways of working with us include Missions, Fractional Teams, DAO, and Guild Access. Clients can have the right talent by tomorrow, and there is no lock-in. We build a specialized team around your specific project and manage it for you. We are not an agency: we assemble a team built just for you, highly vetted, with a 48-hour kick-off. We allow clients to have fast kick-off, match you with a team or submit the project the same day, and manage the whole process for you with just one subscription. We also have a connector rev share enabled through our smart contracts, and cash flows are disrupted if talent leaves.

For freelancers and creator entrepreneurs, we're making this a game you can win. We deliver projects to you, let you choose the way you want to work, charge how much you want, and work solo or multiplayer while growing as a collective. Work and clients come to you based on your skills, availability, and level. A wage imprisons you to one owner, but we enable multiple income sources by contributing to multiple projects. You keep 100% of your earnings, and we pay you right away. You don't need to chase clients for payments or testimonials. We mint rich NFTs that record your work.

## The Features

LancerX is a gamified platform that offers various features to both clients and creators. We have AI-powered matchmaking, on-chain proof of work, gamified reputation, anon work, Lancer OS, certification, and gamified personal achievements for members in the form of NFTs. We also offer proof of revenue, and client progress updates are all-time active updates on progress in the form of a raid taking down a monster (AI-generated).

## How LancerX Makes Money

Clients are charged 10% at the end of each mission, and talent earns 100% of their rate.

## Use Cases

LancerX is perfect for teams that need a specific outcome like building a website, developing an app, writing a whitepaper, writing a smart contract, or launching a token. It is also great for teams that need access to specific talent like web designers, meme developers, community growth experts, marketers, and blockchain developers. It can even crowdsource feedback through a think tank.

## Conclusion

LancerX is the future of freelancing on the Web3. Our platform is gamified, flexible, and efficient, and it offers a gamut of features for both clients and creators. Join us today and experience the future of work on the Web3!

# Lancer Protocol: Bringing Freelancing into the Web3 era

### (We’re making work the way you always wanted it)

## Abstract

Lancer Protocol is a freelancing platform built on ETH Layer 3 that offers clients the ability to assemble a team of highly vetted and top 1% creators for specific outcomes, rather than having to deal with slow and inefficient agencies or unreliable freelancers. Additionally, Lancer Protocol provides creators with the opportunity to work on multiple income sources and build wealth doing what they love, while retaining their autonomy and freedom. This paper presents an overview of the Lancer Protocol, its features, revenue model, growth strategies, and the benefits it provides to clients and creators.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business environment, finding the right talent can be challenging. The traditional freelancing industry is inefficient and unreliable (as we’ll explore below). Lancer Protocol aims to overcome these challenges by offering a flexible and efficient system that benefits both clients and creators.

You can think of Lancer Protocol as the underground talent layer of Web3. It is a game-changing platform that delivers work to freelancers while keeping them in control; letting them work the way they want to work, charge what they want, and work solo or multiplayer, all while growing collectively. By offering a more efficient and transparent way to work, Lancer Protocol aims to revolutionize how work gets outsourced online, and perpetuate the adoption of web3 tech and the freedom economy to come.

## Market Analysis

The freelancing industry is rapidly growing, with more and more people choosing to work as freelancers or independent contractors. The traditional model of employment, with its rigid structures and lack of flexibility, is quickly becoming outdated. The rise of the gig economy has created new opportunities for freelancers and independent contractors, but it has also created new challenges.

In the current state of the freelancing industry,  agencies are slow - with tons of fake agencies flooding the market. Freelancers take weeks to vet and the good ones are notoriously hard to find. Marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork rely on being closed systems: forcing creators to fight on pricing and reviews - a race to the bottom. Recruiters? Attract poor applicants, take a huge chunk of commission and leave you with an employee to manage. Moreover, traditional employment chains creators to one income and limits their potential for professional growth. DAOs, while progressing well, have poor onboarding flows and do little to match client and creator.

Lancer Protocol aims to overcome these challenges by offering a flexible and efficient system that benefits both clients and creators. By providing customized, on-demand teams to clients and multiple income sources to creators, Lancer Protocol enables a digital freedom life for all.

# brainstorm

- AI matching + on-chain are the biggest sellers here. What if we were SaaS instead. Letting Agencies + freelancers prove their work. AI would be able to index and match clients with the right creator/agency to get the job done.
This would solve trust issues + time to find talent
- We could then create a premium service experiment: a DAO and community agency
