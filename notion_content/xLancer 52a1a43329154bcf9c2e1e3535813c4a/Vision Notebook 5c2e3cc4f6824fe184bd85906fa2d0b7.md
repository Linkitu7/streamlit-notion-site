# Vision Notebook

Everything you need to build wealth in the digital economy

The vision I have for the new meta: creator society in the new freedom economy

Join the boldest creators on earth

People from all the globe come here to change their lives

Fiverr is shit
LinkedIn is boring
CVs are lies
Degrees are overrated

Thereâ€™s a better way

#1, vetted, invite only areas
But some areas are open for all
World revealed slowly over time

Like lumin ai

A hub like the above
Ai tools for entrepreneurs breaking free From trad world
My writing that covers how to do it + inspire them about the new economy (like Dan koe has done)
GPT suite but for my audience
Turn your photo into ai avatar in our unique soshi style then inscribe it onto the Bitcoin chain as a promise and dedication
Member directory
Top AI tools and discounts for some
Affiliate communities AKA modern dojos to learn skills from (skills, fitness, etc)
Consult these communities on AI (maybe even build them some solutions too)
Lancer X - get hired for your skills + earn affiliates by joining guilds and passing work
Anyone gets paid - no matter the country. Stripeless. Crypto + escrow + smart contract decentralized
Connecting internet communities to opportunities - quit your 9-5, enter the new economy
Agencies and productised services can tap into our network and we earn % cut from this too
Nft partnerships with major brands and ai tools that we can get discounts and special offers

Tokenise this and members get early investor benefits into any products we launch

All my ideas and projects culminating into one place

That means 1 focus - not split

Combines creating content, personal branding, indie hacking, ai, web3, newsletters,
