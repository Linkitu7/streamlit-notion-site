**`LANCER Protocol`**

- Multiplayer Freelancing
- The underground talent layer of Web3
- Community-powered agency
- Fractional Teams for Startups
- Freedom Economy Platform

## `What is it?`

> An exclusive collective of web3’s finest talent that companies can tap into to get shit done
> 

We could have copy/pasted a web2 model and called it a day

But we believe in web3 as the future of work

For companies, we build the perfect crew for whatever you’re trying to do. Keeping your core team lean and focused, saving thousands of hours and dollars

For freelancers and creator entrepreneurs, we’re making this a game you can win. We deliver projects to you. Let you choose the way you want to work, charge how much you want, and work solo or multiplayer - while growing as a collective.

`**Mission:**`

- Get 1000 lancers out of the matrix
- Perpetuate the adoption of the freedom economy and a Web3 future
- Let brands do more with less by letting them tap into the best talent Web3 has to offer

<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_orange.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/warning_orange.svg" width="40px" /> Warning: this is all experimental. These pages have the power to change the online work space forever

</aside>

$**Thesis**$:

- Future of work is autonomous. The best creators are remote-natives
- Companies will be leaner. Outsourcing the rest.

---

Save time, effort and money by removing inefficiencies in freelancers, agencies or FTH

Creators cut the BS, get to PRINTING cash

### `OLD WAY`

Agencies: 90% suck. 9% average at best. 1% actually good, but expensive

- Agencies are slow
- Agencies stuck competing. We focus on collaboration
- Lots of fake agencies flooding the market. Fake screenshots, fake results, circle-jerk of testimonials
- Agencies are notoriously hard to fire

Freelancers: 90% absolutely shit 9% great but in hiding, 1% high price but unavailable

- Freelancers take weeks to vet
- 90% of Freelancers just suck
- Freelancers that are good, are hard to find or now too expensive
- Freelancers can leave at any point - single point of failure
- Freelancers are separated. Hard to get them to coordinate
- Freelancer work history cannot be verified or not attributed

Marketplaces

- Marketplaces are closed systems (chat and payment)
- Marketplaces leave you to wander aimlessly for the right person
- Marketplaces force creators to fight on pricing and reviews
- Marketplaces keep freelancing single-player
- Marketplaces only good for one off projects. Not consistent growth

Recruiting platforms

- Recruiting marketplaces go half way. They match you with a talented creator but leave you with an employee you have to manage alone

FTH: It costs roughly $4,700 and takes 42 days to fill an open position.

- Most expensive option
- Healthcare, insurance, benefits, etc - hard for anyone without a large runway
- HR nightmare

Current State of DAOs

- DAO’s have bad onboarding flows (both Client and Contributor)
- DAO’s suck lead gen, and therefore growth
- DAO’s limit creator output (responses are often rigid - needing to fit a specific template)
- DAO’s aren’t great at matching client and creator

For Creators

- Not getting recognised, fighting for attention in the algorithm
- Fighting on price in marketplaces
- Traditional employment chains you to one income
- Limited by hourly rates most of the time
- Famine - feast cycles. Prospecting then delivering endless cycle

### `**NEW WAY**`

**Clients**: have a lean team and outsource to top creators for whatever they’re missing

**Creators**: stay autonomous and build wealth doing what they love

**Lancer Network**

- Not an agency
- We assemble a team built just for you
- manage the whole process FOR YOU (one subscription)
- Highly vetted
- 48 hour kick-off
- Visible deadlines for milestone delivery
- One simple subscription built around you. Cancel anytime
- Or one time requests

- For the clients
    - Fast kick off. Match you with a team or submit project same day. One subscription
    - Don’t need to spend 273 hours vetting
    - Doxxed creators - safe
    - Don’t need to spend weeks and months searching for another freelancer or agency, we will set you up with a new team if things aren’t going smooth.
    - We project manage and act as POC (but we won’t bug you)
    - Hire for project. Then can do an ongoing subscription for the guild
    - Keep team lean, and avoid burning runway of some operations. Avoid laying off FTE.
    - Leave old system behind. No more 9-5 bad work.
    - Democratise talent: access it for cheaper, and better. More startups. More innovation. More income scale for individuals
- For creators
    - Work and clients come to you based on your skills, availability and level
    - A wage imprisons you to one owner. Keeps you locked up and give up on a life on your terms. It now belongs to a boss. To build someone else’s dream. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can be free and provide value with your skills. There’s another way
    - Ownership: Share of the DAO, share of client tokens, part of rev.share deals, and other incentives drive higher quality and better performance. Ownership changes the effort and contribution levels
    - Independence - fuel for your digital freedom business
    - Not starting from 0. Same way Lens provides the foundation for dev teams to build great apps and focus on UX… Lancer provides flows, systems, processes, guild support, escrow, etc - for creators to kickstart their income and growth here
    - No 9-5 ever again. Leave that shit behind. Take control of your schedule
    - Don’t need to chase clients for payments. We pay right away
    - Don’t need to chase clients for testimonials. We mint rich NFTs that record your work
    - High quality clients, no BS
    
    TL;DR: Greater autonomy, ownership, share of the upside, as well as opportunities for collaboration and professional growth.
    

- Why me (founder)
    - Always poor until figured out how to make money from digital skills
    - since uni working random dead end jobs felt like my talents and time were wasted when not building an income online
    - Made 6 figure run rate by learning digital skills and launching agencies
    - All in on the freedom economy. Life on your terms. Matrix can be escaped. Employment is a chain. Creating this as a vehicle for people to get out through talent and value drives

    1. Join guilds: taking on X projects to do Y outcomes. Input your skills, availability. Ideal client looks like?
    2. Missions come in. Accept/rejected 
    3. Work on it. Get paid
    4. Work on as much as you want → get paid more
    5. Get great experience and clients that you like

## `FOR WHO`

- COMPANIES, BRANDS: who need work done, but don’t have the talent for it, resources to get it, or time to find it
- WEB3 AGENCIES: who want to reliably outsource and get high quality work in return
- TALENT: who love what they do, and the best at it, but hate the current work systems

## `DEFINITIONS`

`**Missions**:` Are desired outcomes (ex: website redesign for NFT project) + Guilds required (front-end, creative copywriter, designer)

- If desired outcomes are bigger (ex: Website + Growth strategy). The teams communicate and can build a combined strategy with everything considered.

Cohorts - specific outcome (grow account by 2x every week, etc)

Guilds - subscription based access to a guild of creatives, copywriters, etc

## `USE CASES`

- Cases like “rebrand my crypto project” (we assemble appropriate team)
- Hire a chief of memes for a month
- Crowdsource specific knowledge (research done for you)

## FAQ

- And my own creator business?
    - Go ahead. We want you to grow your personal brand and get clients because of who YOU are (and not because they need something done). Takes time to get there, and not everyone wants it, but if that’s you, do it. You can always have that. This is additional, not subtractive, we encourage it. If you’re ever sick, or can’t take on work, you can refer clients to this community and you’ll get a cut.

### `GROWTH STRATEGIES`

- Content: throw stones at the enemy. Marketplaces, agencies, recruiting, etc
- Resistance : community for the project. Made of creators saying no the old world.
- NFT projects, crypto projects, web3 startups, web3 agencies, trad agencies
- VC growth companies that need a hand without a full time hire commitment (spend money on ser acquisition and improving product)
- Partner with VCs - offer specific services to their portfolio of clients
- Partner with NFT Projects - provide utility for the builders in the community: let your members build for you and for others.
- Partner with education creators and companies. Get their talented creators work in web3 on their terms.
- Affiliate: Tokens/XP for referrals to the network that end up going through (perpetual)
- Gamification: Yokyo story revealed one pieces at a time, the more levels they get through (cotribution, projects, etc) - share a narrative together

**Product led growth:** SAAS model. First collaboration is free. To add more, need to upgrade to subscription plan

Narrative and culture driven through our brand, nft community and broader content from soshi and members

# Building it

To make an MVP for the Lancer Protocol project, you can use no-code tools such as Bubble or Webflow to create a simple website or web application that showcases the key features of the platform. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Define the key features of the MVP based on the information in the document. For example, the ability to submit a mission, assemble a team, and track progress could be important features to include.
2. Use a no-code tool like Bubble or Webflow to create a simple landing page that explains what the platform does and how it works. Be sure to highlight the key features you identified in step 1.
3. Create a sign-up form where users can create an account to access the platform. You can use a no-code tool like Airtable or Google Sheets to collect user information.
4. Once users have created an account, give them access to the platform where they can submit a mission or assemble a team. Use a no-code tool like Zapier or Integromat to integrate with APIs that will handle the mission or team assembly process.
5. Assemble a team of creators who can work on the submitted mission. Use a no-code tool like Slack or Discord to communicate with the team and track progress.
6. Once the mission is complete, use a no-code tool like Airtable or Google Sheets to track progress and record completed work.
7. Mint NFTs that record the completed work to ensure transparency and trust between clients and creators.
8. Use a no-code tool like Mailchimp or Sendgrid to send out updates to clients and creators and keep them engaged with the platform.

Keep in mind that this is just a rough outline, and there are many details to consider when building an MVP. However, by following these steps and using no-code tools, you can quickly and easily create a functioning prototype that showcases the key features of the Lancer Protocol platform.

# brainstorm

- AI matching + on-chain are the biggest sellers here. What if we were SaaS instead. Letting Agencies + freelancers prove their work. AI would be able to index and match clients with the right creator/agency to get the job done.
This would solve trust issues + time to find talent
- We could then create a premium service experiment: a DAO and community agency
