# The Lance Difference (why you should care)

### `OLD WAY`

Agencies: 90% suck. 9% average at best. 1% actually good, but expensive

- Agencies are slow
- Agencies stuck competing. We focus on collaboration
- Lots of fake agencies flooding the market. Fake screenshots, fake results, circle-jerk of testimonials
- Agencies are notoriously hard to fire

Freelancers: 90% absolutely shit 9% great but in hiding, 1% high price but unavailable

- Freelancers take weeks to vet
- 90% of Freelancers just suck
- Freelancers that are good, are hard to find or now too expensive
- Freelancers can leave at any point - single point of failure
- Freelancers are separated. Hard to get them to coordinate
- Freelancer work history cannot be verified or not attributed

Marketplaces

- Marketplaces are closed systems (chat and payment)
- Marketplaces leave you to wander aimlessly for the right person
- Marketplaces force creators to fight on pricing and reviews
- Marketplaces keep freelancing single-player
- Marketplaces only good for one off projects. Not consistent growth

Recruiting platforms

- Recruiting marketplaces go half way. They match you with a talented creator but leave you with an employee you have to manage alone

FTH: It costs roughly $4,700 and takes 42 days to fill an open position.

- Most expensive option
- Healthcare, insurance, benefits, etc - hard for anyone without a large runway
- HR nightmare

Current State of DAOs

- DAO’s have bad onboarding flows (both Client and Contributor)
- DAO’s suck lead gen, and therefore growth
- DAO’s limit creator output (responses are often rigid - needing to fit a specific template)
- DAO’s aren’t great at matching client and creator

For Creators

- Not getting recognised, fighting for attention in the algorithm
- Fighting on price in marketplaces
- Traditional employment chains you to one income
- Limited by hourly rates most of the time
- Famine - feast cycles. Prospecting then delivering endless cycle

### `**NEW WAY**`

**Clients**: have a lean team and outsource to top creators for whatever they’re missing

**Creators**: stay autonomous and build wealth doing what they love

**Lancer Network**

- Not an agency
- We assemble a team built just for you
- manage the whole process FOR YOU (one subscription)
- Highly vetted
- 48 hour kick-off
- Visible deadlines for milestone delivery
- One simple subscription built around you. Cancel anytime
- Or one time requests

- For the clients
    - Fast kick off. Match you with a team or submit project same day. One subscription
    - Don’t need to spend 273 hours vetting
    - Doxxed creators - safe
    - Don’t need to spend weeks and months searching for another freelancer or agency, we will set you up with a new team if things aren’t going smooth.
    - We project manage and act as POC (but we won’t bug you)
    - Hire for project. Then can do an ongoing subscription for the guild
    - Keep team lean, and avoid burning runway of some operations. Avoid laying off FTE.
    - Leave old system behind. No more 9-5 bad work.
    - Democratise talent: access it for cheaper, and better. More startups. More innovation. More income scale for individuals
- For creators
    - Work and clients come to you based on your skills, availability and level
    - A wage imprisons you to one owner. Keeps you locked up and give up on a life on your terms. It now belongs to a boss. To build someone else’s dream. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can be free and provide value with your skills. There’s another way
    - Ownership: Share of the DAO, share of client tokens, part of rev.share deals, and other incentives drive higher quality and better performance. Ownership changes the effort and contribution levels
    - Independence - fuel for your digital freedom business
    - Not starting from 0. Same way Lens provides the foundation for dev teams to build great apps and focus on UX… Lancer provides flows, systems, processes, guild support, escrow, etc - for creators to kickstart their income and growth here
    - No 9-5 ever again. Leave that shit behind. Take control of your schedule
    - Don’t need to chase clients for payments. We pay right away
    - Don’t need to chase clients for testimonials. We mint rich NFTs that record your work
    - High quality clients, no BS
    
    TL;DR: Greater autonomy, ownership, share of the upside, as well as opportunities for collaboration and professional growth.
    

- Why me (founder)
    - Always poor until figured out how to make money from digital skills
    - since uni working random dead end jobs felt like my talents and time were wasted when not building an income online
    - Made 6 figure run rate by learning digital skills and launching agencies
    - All in on the freedom economy. Life on your terms. Matrix can be escaped. Employment is a chain. Creating this as a vehicle for people to get out through talent and value drives

## What is Lancer X?

Freelancing 3.0 (that good it skipped 2.0)

Think of Lancer X as ‘the’ places companies and Lancers come to find each other

When Teams need something done, or a specific group of people to get it done, they usually have a few options: Agencies, freelancers, gig marketplaces, or recruiters. They all have their pros and cons (we dunk on all of them later), but now there’s a new option, that was built for both Lancers AND the companies hiring them.

With guilds…. clients we run into might want to have little things done here and there. to make it really easy; we offer them access to the guild subscription that the guild has set up. Tasks can be worked in the team, and this can be voted on by the team members on how they want to work it. Our goal is to provide flexible payment options that works for clients the way they want to, and answers the market demand in a meaningful way, better than trad institutions would.

# Lancer Protocol: Bringing Freelancing into the Web3 era

### (We’re making work the way you always wanted it)

## Abstract

Lancer Protocol is a freelancing platform built on ETH Layer 3 that offers clients the ability to assemble a team of highly vetted and top 1% creators for specific outcomes, rather than having to deal with slow and inefficient agencies or unreliable freelancers. Additionally, Lancer Protocol provides creators with the opportunity to work on multiple income sources and build wealth doing what they love, while retaining their autonomy and freedom. This paper presents an overview of the Lancer Protocol, its features, revenue model, growth strategies, and the benefits it provides to clients and creators.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business environment, finding the right talent can be challenging. The traditional freelancing industry is inefficient and unreliable (as we’ll explore below). Lancer Protocol aims to overcome these challenges by offering a flexible and efficient system that benefits both clients and creators.

You can think of Lancer Protocol as the underground talent layer of Web3. It is a game-changing platform that delivers work to freelancers while keeping them in control; letting them work the way they want to work, charge what they want, and work solo or multiplayer, all while growing collectively. By offering a more efficient and transparent way to work, Lancer Protocol aims to revolutionize how work gets outsourced online, and perpetuate the adoption of web3 tech and the freedom economy to come.

## Market Analysis

The freelancing industry is rapidly growing, with more and more people choosing to work as freelancers or independent contractors. The traditional model of employment, with its rigid structures and lack of flexibility, is quickly becoming outdated. The rise of the gig economy has created new opportunities for freelancers and independent contractors, but it has also created new challenges.

In the current state of the freelancing industry,  agencies are slow - with tons of fake agencies flooding the market. Freelancers take weeks to vet and the good ones are notoriously hard to find. Marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork rely on being closed systems: forcing creators to fight on pricing and reviews - a race to the bottom. Recruiters? Attract poor applicants, take a huge chunk of commission and leave you with an employee to manage. Moreover, traditional employment chains creators to one income and limits their potential for professional growth. DAOs, while progressing well, have poor onboarding flows and do little to match client and creator.

Lancer Protocol aims to overcome these challenges by offering a flexible and efficient system that benefits both clients and creators. By providing customized, on-demand teams to clients and multiple income sources to creators, Lancer Protocol enables a digital freedom life for all.

## Features

Lancer Protocol offers a range of features that make it a unique and valuable platform for clients and creators alike:

### Multiplayer freelancing

### Gamified reputation levels and achievements

Lancer Protocol offers gamified reputation levels and achievements, providing creators with the opportunity to earn rewards for their contributions and achieve higher levels of reputation on the platform.

### Progress updates in the form of an AI-generated raid

Lancer Protocol provides progress updates in the form of an AI-generated raid, making the platform more fun and engaging for creators.

## Revenue Model

Lancer Protocol's revenue model is simple and effective. Demand (clients) are charged 10% at the end of projects and squad subscriptions, while talent (supply) earns 100% of their rate. Lancer Protocol also earns a referral fee from specialized teams (partner agencies).

## Growth Strategies

Lancer Protocol's growth strategies focus on building a community of creators who reject the old world and embrace the freedom economy. The platform aims to partner with VCs, NFT projects, and education creators and companies, and provide services to their portfolios. By building a culture and narrative around its brand and community, Lancer Protocol aims to attract a certain type of creator and client who value collaboration, autonomy, and professional growth.

## Conclusion

Lancer Protocol is a unique and valuable platform that offers a more efficient and transparent way to work. By providing clients with customized, on-demand teams and creators with multiple income sources and the freedom to work on their terms, Lancer Protocol enables a digital freedom life for all. The economics of the platform work out in favor of both clients and creators, making it a game-changing platform for the future of work. Lancer Protocol aims to transform the freelancing industry and perpetuate the adoption of web3 tech and the freedom economy.

## Conclusion

This paper is not perfect, and open to criticism and different perspectives

This is a pretty rough approximation of how we believe this system can work. Open to criticism and seeing how this plays out.
