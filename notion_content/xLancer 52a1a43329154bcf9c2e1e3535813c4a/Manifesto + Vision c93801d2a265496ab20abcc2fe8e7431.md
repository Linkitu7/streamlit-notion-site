# Manifesto + Vision

We’re freelancing 3.0. A web3 solution to outsourcing work, and the best place for freelancers to grow into a freedom business.

Helping Teams build leaner companies that achieve scale, without killing their profits.

Helping creators build lifestyle businesses to enjoy from their efforts, without worrying so much about where their next paycheck will come from.

Our bet:

- Startups and companies will be leaner in the future
- Those lean teams need access to the right talent for different things, and fast.
- The trad systems cannot handle this load
- We enable those teams to tap into best creators on the web - trustless, fast, secure.

We are not a faceless agency or an evil marketplace. We are a community of innovators and builders, pushing the adoption of web3 and the freedom economy. Our mission is to help creators break free from traditional employment chains and build wealth doing what they love. We believe in democratizing access to talent, and unlocking income scale for individuals and companies.

Join us on this journey to redefine the future of work.

Let's build and grow together!

(we’re also making this whole work online thing wayyyyyyyyy more fun - so stay tuned!)

Here comes a new wave...
And surfing here is different.
Breaking down barriers.
Building open communities.
Creating magic internet money with our friends.
To those who don't get it, we tell them: gm.
They'll come around eventually.

Here's to the ones with the courage to jump down a peculiar rabbit hole.
One that pulls you away from a world that's created by many and owned by few...
To a world that's created by more and owned by all.
From The Garden come the human beans that sprout into your family.

We rise together.
We build together.
We grow together.

Ready to take the red bean?
